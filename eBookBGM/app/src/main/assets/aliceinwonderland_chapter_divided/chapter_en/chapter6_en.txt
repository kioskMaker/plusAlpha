Chapter 6. Pig and Pepper


She stood looking at the house for a minute or two. I'm thinking about what to do now.
At that time, a servant in uniform jumped out of the forest and violently knocked on the door with his two fists.
Alice thought of him as a servant because of the uniform he was wearing, although honestly, it seemed more reasonable to call him a water ring just by looking at his face.
Soon another servant in uniform opened the door. But he was a round-faced frog with big eyes.
They were both servants.
Alice looked, and there was powder all over their curly hair.
Curious about what was going on, she stepped out of the forest to overhear their conversation. 
The fish servant soon held out a large letter under his arm. It was really a letter the size of his body.
The fish servant handed it to the other person and said in a solemn tone.
"To the Duchess, send an invitation to play croquet from Her Majesty."
The frog servant repeated in the same solemn tone. Just a slight change in word order.
"From Her Majesty, an invitation to play croquet to the Duchess has been received."


Finally, when they greeted each other facing each other, their curly hair became tangled.
Alice burst into laughter when she saw it, but she hurriedly crawled back into the forest, fearing that they might have heard it.
When I looked out again, the fish servant was gone, and only the frog servant sat on the floor by the door and stared at the sky.
Alice went shyly to the door and knocked.
"It would be no use knocking," said the servant. "There are two reasons. One is that I'm outside the door with you, and the second reason is that it's so noisy inside that no one will hear you knock."
The house was definitely very noisy… I could hear the cries and sneezes constantly, and sometimes I could hear the clatter of plates and pots falling to pieces.
"Then I will," said Alice. "How can I go inside?"
"If there is a door between us," continued the servant, without giving her an eye. "Knock will do you good. For example, if you knock inside, I could have opened the door for you to come out."
He was only looking up at the sky throughout the conversation.
That attitude was considered very rude to Alice.
"Because the eyes are on the top of her head," she said to herself. "I guess so. Anyway, let's hear the answer... So how can I get inside?" she repeated loudly.
"I'm by tomorrow," replied the servant. "I'll sit here…”
At that moment, the door of the house popped open, a large plate flew over, and it narrowly grazed the servant's head. Soon the plate clattered against one of the trees behind him.
"…or until the next day," said the servant, leisurely, as if nothing had happened.
"How do I get in?" Alice asked again, louder.
"You're going in?" said the servant. "That's the first question, isn't it?"
I couldn't even talk back because it was undoubtedly true.
"It's terrible," she murmured to herself. "The animals here are always like this. To the point of annoyance!"
Perhaps the gap was considered an opportunity, so the servant explained what he had just said.
"I'll sit here, if not always, for a few days."
"And me?" said Alice.
"Do as you please," said the servant, and began whistling.
"It's no use talking to him," Alice said hopelessly. "I'm not a fool!"
Then she opened the door and went in herself.



The door was directly connected to the big kitchen. There was smoke all over the place. 
The Duchess was sitting on a three-legged chair in the middle of the kitchen, soothing the baby, and the cook was leaning over the stove, stirring a large pot that seemed to be full of soup.
"I must have put too much pepper in the soup!" Alice said to herself. I kept sneezing.
There must have been a lot of ground pepper in the kitchen air. Even the Duchess sneezed often. Even the baby sneezed, and the baby was struggling and whining for a moment.
The only one in the kitchen who didn't sneeze was the cook and the big cat sitting on the stove, whipping from ear to ear.
"No, why," said Alice, a little discouraged. Because I didn't think it was good manners to ask like that at first sight. "Why is your cat breaking me apart like that?"”
"Because it's a Cheshire cat," said the Duchess. "Yes, you pig!"
That last word came as a shock. So I was absent-minded for a moment, and it turned out that the Duchess had said to the baby, not Alice. Only then did Alice have the courage to talk to me.
"I didn't know that cats in Cheshire were always splitting apart, even for the first time I knew that cats could laugh."
"All cats can do that," said the Duchess. "I mean most of them."
"I've never seen it before," Alice said politely. I was very happy to talk to the Duchess.
"Actually," said the Duchess. "There's a lot you don't know."
The way she spoke didn't come close at all, so Alice wanted to move on to another topic.
So while she was pondering the topic of the new conversation, the cook took the pot of soup out of the fire and threw whatever she could reach at the Duchess and the baby... 
First, the pot flew in, and then pots, plates, and trays came showering.
The Duchess didn't seem to care at all, even though they flew to her and hit her. The baby was also a full-body from the beginning, so it was hard to tell if he was crying because the tray flew in and it was painful.
"Oh, what are you doing now!" said Alice, jumping up and down in great fear. "All the expensive trays are being broken."
I felt dizzy how big pots were passing by so narrowly.
"If only people had cared about their work anyway," said the Duchess in a growling tone. "The world would have worked much better than it does now."
"I don't think so," said Alice. In addition, Alice thought she had a golden opportunity to show off her shallow knowledge, and said, "Think about changing night and day! The Earth revolves around its axis every 24 hours...”
"If you're going to talk about axes," said the Duchess. "I want you to open your neck!"
Alice looked at the chef anxiously, but he seemed to have been too busy stirring the soup to hear.
So Alice kept saying,
"If it's not 24 hours, then is it 12 hours?" So it's...”
"Don't bother me," said the Duchess. "Number is annoying!"
The Duchess began to soothe her baby again. In the meantime, the Duchess tried to put her to sleep by stopping by a lullaby, but she flashed the baby in every lyric. I put it down.


"If you sneeze, you'll hit him. If you sneeze, you'll do that, so you won't do it again."
Chorus. "Wow! Wow! Wow!"


While singing the second verse, the Duchess threw the baby up and down violently, so the poor baby cried more loudly. Because of that, Alice couldn't hear any lyrics to the song...


"Harshly to the child, if you sneeze, you hit him.I'm so happy. When you're happy, put a lot of pepper!"
Chorus. "Wow! Wow! Wow!"


"Here! You take care of it!" said the Duchess, throwing the baby at Alice. "I have to go out to get ready for the croquet game with Her Majesty." 
Then the Duchess hurried out of the room.
After the Duchess left, the cook threw a frying pan, but it barely missed.
Alice had to hold the baby a little hard, as if it were a strange-looking animal, stretching its arms and legs in all directions.
'Like a starfish,' thought Alice.
Alice holds the baby for the first time, as the little one blew his nose and breathed heavily like a steam locomotive while holding it. I almost missed it. I grabbed it again. Fortunately, after a while, I was able to hold the baby well.
I've got a new way to do it. You wrap it like a knot, and then you grab the right ear and the left foot, and it doesn't untangle anymore.
She came out holding the baby.
'We have to take the baby,' thought Alice. "If you leave it in this house, can they kill you in a day or two?"”
I think the baby is responding to this, but it sounds like a gulping sound. By that time, the baby's sneezing had stopped.
"Don't whine," said Alice. "That's not the right expression for you."
The baby was wheezing again. So I looked anxiously into the baby's face, and somehow the baby's nose was a wild spear nose, much closer to the snout of a pig than a nose. And his eyes were much smaller than the baby's. Alice didn't have a good look at all.
'Maybe it's because I cried so much,' thought Alice, and looked at the face again. I want to see if there are tears left.
But somehow, there wasn't a tear.
"Then are you really going to turn into a pig, my dear," Alice said gravely. "Then I can't go with you anymore. Let's go now!"
The poor thing sobbed again, no, it sobbed, it wasn't old enough to say, and then they both went into silent mode.
I had this thought to ALICE.
What should I do with him when I go home?’
At that time, it was grunting more roughly again, so Alice was surprised and looked into his face, and this time he looked like a real pig. I couldn't take him anymore.


So Alice put the poor thing down, and she was relieved to walk quietly into the forest.
"When you grow up," Alice said to herself. "I'll grow up to be a very ugly child. But he's handsome for a pig."
She began to think of the names of other children who looked like pigs she knew. 
And then I said this.
"Even if you turn into a pig, there's only one cheap kid…"”
Then her eyes met with a Cheshire cat sitting on a branch a few meters away and she was slightly surprised.
The cat only smiled at Alice.
'You look nice,' thought Alice. But you have a lot of long claws and big teeth. There's no harm in being careful.’
"Cheshire meow," she said, a little frightened, wondering what if she didn't like the name. But the cat only smiled more broadly.
"Come on, so far so good," Alice continued, thinking. "Do you want me to tell you where to go now?"


"It depends on where you want to go," said the cat.
"You can go anywhere…"said Alice.
"Then it doesn't matter where you go," said the cat.
"…but I have to go everywhere," Alice added.
"Then as long as you walk enough," said the cat. "It doesn't work."
For Alice, I was speechless. So I tried to think of another question.
"Who lives around here?"
"Over there," said the cat, waving its right foot. "A hat seller lives. On this side," he said, shaking his left foot this time. "The rabbit lives in March. Go wherever you like. Because they're both crazy."
"But I don't want to go to crazy people," said Alice.
"Oh, that can't be helped," said the cat. "Because we're all crazy here. I'm crazy, you're crazy."
"How do you know I'm crazy?" said Alice.
"You must be crazy," said the cat. "If not, you wouldn't be here.”
Alice didn't agree with me. But she kept talking to her.
"Then how do you know you're crazy?"
"First of all," said the cat. "Puppies aren't crazy. Don't you agree with that?"
"Yes, I think so," said Alice.
"Well," continued the cat. "Let's see. Dogs growl when they're angry and wag their tails when they're happy. But I growl when I'm happy and wag my tail when I'm angry. That's why I'm crazy."
"It's not growling, it's saying it's whispering," said Alice.
"Call me whatever you like," said the cat. "Then are you also playing croquet with Her Majesty today?”
"I think I've heard a lot today," said Alice. "But I haven't been invited yet."
"You'll see me there," said the cat, and suddenly disappeared.
For Alice, this was not surprising. As I get used to such strange things happening.
While she was trying to figure out where to go, the cat appeared again for a moment.
"By the way, what happened to the baby?" said the cat. "I forgot to ask.”
"I turned into a pig," said Alice calmly, as if it were not awkward for the cat to reappear in that way.
"I thought so," said the cat, and then disappeared again.
Alice waited for a moment in anticipation of the cat appearing again, but it did not appear any more.
So, a minute or two later, I was walking to the rabbit house in March.
"I've seen a hat seller before," she said to herself. "I think March Rabbit will be more fun. Now that it's May, you're probably not completely crazy.... At least it can't be as crazy as March."
While saying this, I suddenly looked up and found a cat on the branch again.
"Did you say pig or daisy?" said the cat.
"I said pig," Alice replied. "But you can't just pop up and disappear like that. I feel dizzy."
"All right," said the cat, and this time it disappeared very slowly. First of all, the tail disappeared, and then finally, the smile was left for a long time. Laughter remained there for a long time after the cat disappeared and then disappeared.


`Really! I've never seen such a smiling cat,' thought Alice. "But this time, there's no cat, but only laughter remains! I've never seen such a strange sight before in my life!"
I didn't go far, so I saw the house where rabbits live in March.
The reason I guessed it at once was that all the chimneys in the house had rabbit ears and the roof was covered with fur. 
But it was a very large house, so she had the courage to approach it after she first ate a little bit of the mushroom in her left hand and raised it to 60 centimeters.
A little intimidated, she approached the house and said to herself.
"What a crazy rabbit! I should've just gone to the hat dealer!"
