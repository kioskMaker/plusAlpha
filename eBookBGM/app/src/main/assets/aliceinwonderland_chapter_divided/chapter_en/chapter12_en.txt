Chapter 12. Alice's Testimony


"Here!" cried Alice. He had completely forgotten his incredibly covered body.
She was in a hurry to get up, and the end of the skirt got caught in the jury, and the jury flipped over, and the jury fell underneath it, with her head down. As the jury lay all over with her arms and legs stretched out, Alice remembered the goldfish tank she had accidentally spilled the week before.


"Oh, I'm sorry!" exclaimed Alice in astonishment. And I started picking up the jury as quickly as I could because I kept thinking about the goldfish fishing port thing in my head, and I had a vague idea that I could die if I didn't put the jury on the jury seat quickly.
"Until the jury is all seated…. " said the king in a very solemn tone. "You will not be able to start a trial."
As he said this, the king glared at Alice with a fierce look.
Alice was in a hurry and put Little Lizard Bill on the seat with his head down, and the poor thing couldn't move and was wagging its tail endlessly.  
She picked up the lizard again and turned her body properly.
"Even if it was the other way round," Alice said to herself. "It wouldn't have been a big variable.”
As soon as the jury escaped from the spill, they immediately found their stone tablets and pencils, held them in their hands, and began to write down what had just happened. Except for one little lizard, Bill. He was completely distraught, his mouth wide open, and he was staring at the court ceiling.
"What do you know about this?" the king asked Alice.
"Nothing," said Alice.
"Nothing, really?" the king asked again and again.
"I really don't know anything," said Alice.
"Well, that's an important fact," said the king, looking back at the jury. 
The jury began to write the words on their stone tablets. 
The white rabbit stepped in freaked out.
"You're saying it's not important, Your Majesty," said the White Rabbit, very politely, but with a face full of arrogance.
"It's not important, uh, of course it is," the king said in a hurry, and soon he killed his voice and started talking to himself. "Is it important…Is it not important…" It's not important... It was like, "Is it important?" It was like, "Which word is better to pronounce than the meaning of a word?"
So some jurors wrote "important," while others wrote "important."
At this time, Alice was also close to them, so she could look into the jury's stone tablets. 
'It doesn't matter,' she thought to herself.
Meanwhile, the king began to write something in his notebook, and soon he said, "Silence!" and washed away the noise of the courtroom and began to read his notebook aloud.
"Under Article 42 of the Rules, anyone who is over one kilometer tall must leave court.”
Then everyone looked at Alice.
"I'm not one kilometer tall," said Alice. 
"I think so," said the king.
"It looks like almost two kilometers," added Her Majesty.
"I'm not going out anyway," said Alice. "And what other rules are there? Don't you think I don't know what you just made."
"This is the oldest rule in the book.said the king.
"Then shouldn't it be Article 1 of the rules?"“
The king's face turned blue and hurriedly covered his notebook.
"Give me a verdict.The king's voice was shaking low as he spoke to the jury.
"There is more clear evidence than that, Your Majesty," said the White Rabbit, jumping up and down. "This letter is a clear proof that cannot be undone."
"What's in it?" said Her Majesty.
"I haven't opened it yet," said the white rabbit. "I think there's a letter in it. I'm sure the unsub... It seems certain that it was written it."
"I suppose so," said the king. "Since it's a letter, there must be someone who receives it, of course."
"Whose letter is it for?" said one of the jurors.
"There is no specific address," said the white rabbit. "No, nothing is written on the envelope."
As he said that, the white rabbit opened the paper and added:
"It's not a letter, it's like a combination of words."
"Is it handwritten?" asked another jury.
"No, no," said the White Rabbit. "It's a list of weird things that can't even be called writing."
This confused the whole jury.
"If you imitate someone's handwriting, it must be less," said the king.
Only then did the jury's face brighten up again.
"Please, Your Majesty," said Jack. "I don't know how to write, I don't know how to sign at the end."
"If you didn't sign," said the king. It just makes things worse. If you had no impure intentions and were honest, wouldn't you have signed it in your name anyway?"
People's thunderous applause poured out at this remark.
That was really the most lucid first thing the king said on this day.
"This has cleared him of his sins," said Her Majesty.
"No way!" said Alice. "You don't even know what the letter is about!"
"Read the letter," said the king.
The White Rabbit took out his glasses and put them on and asked, "Where should I start, Your Highness?"
"From the beginning," said the king sternly. "Read it all and stop.”
So the White Rabbit read…


"I've been to her, but people asked me,
That's why I told him.
She gave me a letter of recommendation.
But I told you, I can't swim.
 
He told people, he didn't go.
(We know it's true.)
When she sticks to her pod,
What happens to you?

I gave her one, they gave him two.
You gave us more than three.
They got back both from him and you.All right.
Although they got yours back before then.

If I and she were to be involved in this,
I think he's gonna get involved.
Whether to put them out or not.
He'll leave it up to you.
Exactly who we are now.

I mean, I mean,
between him and us and it
The obstacle is you.

Don't let him know she loves them.
Because it's absolutely necessary.
Between you and me.
It's a secret different from all the rest."


"I have never heard more clear evidence in my life," said the king, rubbing his hands. "Then the jury now try to reach a verdict…”
"It's easy to explain," said Alice. She had grown so big in these few minutes that she was not afraid to interrupt the king's "It could be that the parties lent 10,000 won to each other, I don't believe there's anything up there."
All the jurors wrote it down on the stone.
"She says she doesn't believe there's anything up there."
But none of the jurors tried to write the contents of the previous letter on the stone tablet.
"If you don't have a heart," said the king. "It can take a lot of trouble. Because we don't have to look for anything. But let's see." The king opened the letter on his lap and began to look carefully with one eye. "Well, 'I can't swim...'This phrase seems to mean something, so do you know how to swim?' said the king, turning to Jack.
Jack shook his head sadly and said, "Do I look like that?" It couldn't have been that way, because it was a card made entirely of cardboard.
"Yes, that seems to be the case," said the king, and began to read the lines of the letter again.
And then... 
Let's see, we know it's true...This part... 'I gave her one, they gave him two...This phrase, 'You know what you're going to do with those fruit pies in advance, right...”
"But if you keep looking, 'they've got it back from him and you.'Yes,' said Alice.
"Yes, it's there!" said the king, intoxicated with victory. He was pointing at the fruit pies on the table. "Nothing is more obvious than this. Then let's watch it again...'Till she's furious...'Let's see, honey, you've never been as angry as fire, have you?' the king said to the queen.
"Never once!" said Her Majesty angrily. The Queen herself was speaking, and she was furious that little lizard Bill was speaking, and Her Majesty threw an inkstand at Bill.
Little Lizard Bill was sorry that he could not write anything on his stone all that day, and now he could write something on it in a hurry using the ink while the drops of ink that had just spilled on his face were dripping from his face.
"Yes, the expression 'fire rage' is not suitable for you," the king said, and looked around the court with a gentle smile.
It was such a nonsense that the audience was silent as if they were dead.


"It's a joke!" said the king over and over again before everyone burst into laughter.
"Then the jury will give you a verdict," the king said 20 times on this day alone.
"Not yet, not yet!" said Her Majesty. "The sentence comes first… The verdict is later."
"That's complete nonsense!" said Alice loudly. "What do you mean sentencing comes first!"
"You can't shut that mouth!" said Her Majesty, her face turning red.
"No!" said Alice.
"Hit him on the head!" the Queen said in a low voice, but no one moved.
"Do you think I care about you?" said Alice. "They're nothing more than cardboard cards!"
Yes, she was now completely back to her old size. 


At that moment, all the cards rose from all sides and poured down on her from the sky.
Alice shrieked half-surprised and half-angry and tried to tear them apart, and it turned out to be herself lying on the bank of the river with her head cut on her sister's lap. Alice was gently shaking off some of the leaves that fell gently on her face from the trees.
"Wake up, sweet Alice!" she said. "How can you sleep so long!”
"Oh, what a strange dream!" said Alice.
And Alice told her sister everything she had heard before about all the unfamiliar adventures, as well as what she remembered.
When Alice finished talking, she gave her sister a light kiss and said,
"What a strange dream, my pretty girl, then let's run for tea now. I'll be late."
So Alice got up and ran. 
I thought about it as I ran. 
"It was a really interesting dream!"
She still remained there after sending her brother away. Leaning his head in his hand, he was looking at the setting sun, thinking of little Alice and her wonderful adventures. Then I felt like my sister started dreaming, too, the following dream...
First of all, she felt like she was a little Alice, those bright eyes looking up at her with her hands wrapped around her knees... I could hear my sister's own voice, and there was a strange way of shaking her head slightly to push back the hair that had been rambling down her eyes… And still listening, and it seemed to be audible, the strange animals and birds that came out of her little brother's dreams alive and moving around her.
At her feet, the long grass rustled like a white rabbit rushing by… A mouse, startled by the wind, was jumping into a nearby pool of water… In March, I heard the rabbit and his friends bumping into each other's teacups over an endless meal, and I heard the Queen's tearful voice ordering her unlucky guests to be sentenced to death... On the Duchess' lap, the "pig baby" was sneezing one after another, and in the meantime, plates and trays were clattering all over the kitchen... Griffin's shrill voice, little lizard Bill's pencil-writing on the slate, and the restrained guinea pigs' gasping of breath filled the air and soon became one with the pathetic sobbing of the Fake Turtle from afar.
Yes, she sat there with her eyes closed, half believing she was in a strange land, half believing she was in a strange land, yes, knowing that when she opened her eyes, everything would return to a heavy reality... The grass will be the rustling of the wind, and the splash of puddles will be the shaking of the reeds... The sound of the teacups hitting would turn into the sound of the bells hanging from the sheep's neck, and the sharp shouts of Her Majesty would turn into the voice of a shepherd… And while the baby's sneezing, Griffin's sharpness, and the heavy sobbing of the fake turtle turned into the cries of livestock from afar, she knew all the other strange noises would turn into the buzz of a busy farm.
Lastly, she drew in her mind how her brother would grow afterwards. Even as an adult, Alice will retain her childhood innocence and lovely heart. Then maybe you'll gather the young children together and light up and excite them with this strange and fun dream story of a strange country a long time ago. She will also have the pleasure of smiling slightly, sharing her children's innocent sadness and plain joy, recalling this happy summer day of her own childhood.
